 * This function assigns the given data item and updates the number of clusters if it is assigned to a new cluster.
 * It does not reassign other data items. Hence, it is a single update step. This naturally has disadvantages for
 * problems where we might converge faster if we would be able to re-assign a set of data points at once. The latter
 * is the idea behind split and merge samplers.
 *
 * The partition under consideration emerges from calling this update() function regularly. The data points only
 * enter the equation through the likelihood function where the number of data points per cluster determines their
 * relative weight. This can be seen as some kind of voting mechanism. However, there is no "guidance" of the chain
 * to partitions of data that might make more sense. The MCMC is not data-driven. Sampling of the cluster parameters
 * is a not data-driven either. We just sample from the base distribution "_nonparametrics.sample_base" without 
 * regard for that part of parameter space that makes sense from the perspective of the data.
